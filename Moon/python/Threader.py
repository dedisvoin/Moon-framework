Threader module
----------------
Small helper classes to run work in background threads. This module provides three
types of worker primitives used across the Moon framework:

- Worker: a simple one-shot worker that runs a callable in a background thread.
- CycleWorker: runs a callable repeatedly with a configurable delay between runs.
- PromiseWorker: executes a callable and stores its result (or exception) for
  later retrieval â€” similar to a very small, framework-specific "future".

This file only contains tiny helpers (no scheduling or pooling). The comments and
docstrings are intentionally verbose to match the style used in `Window.py`.
No runtime behaviour is changed.
